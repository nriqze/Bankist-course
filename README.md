# Bankist
My approach to a course project.
During a javascript course that I took, we develoed a net-banking like app and a web site. Those were two separete projects.
I redone those and link them, so we could navigate from the website to the app.
I redone the exercise by myself, the javascript part. The html and css were made by the instructor, as mentioned in the page itself.
I made some minor changes that I like to call improvements.
